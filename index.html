                    If your opponent is throwing the Rousseau Gambit at you, it's like they're serving you a spicy dish of chess chaos. Why not dig in and spice it up even more by sacrificing your knight on d4? It's like saying, 'I'll see your gambit and raise you a knight!' Watch their reaction as they realize they've unleashed a gambit beast they weren't quite prepared for! <a href="https://openings-explorer.web.app/training/bZdzUvWxgLVwAXXCG3RD">Import (73 moves)</a>

                    If you enjoy playing the Alapin Sicilian or the Accelerated Panov Attack as White, you often find yourself in positions with an isolated pawn on d4 after the exchange of central pawns. A common idea is to advance the isolated pawn forward. <a href="https://openings-explorer.web.app/training/89XKh9E51QNdeFyjIbAb">Import (79 moves)</a> However, if Black opts for queen exchanges, it's also useful to know what to do in such a situation. <a href="https://openings-explorer.web.app/training/ZUyRl9mtQVhHEJ9osuu6">Import (79 moves)</a>

Instead of accepting the gambit 3...exf4 which gives White initiative and a strong control over the center, you can counter-attack White by playing 3...d5. Watch the full video lesson to learn some of the most deadliest traps in this variation. In one of the lines, White is losing in just 8 moves! <a href="https://openings-explorer.web.app/training/12sBPcBjaAExCKVlxQAg">Import (27 moves)</a>

                    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y6-RXOh50_w" target="_blank">In this video lesson</a>, GM Igor Smirnov talks about the most underrated chess gambit for Black against the White's first move 1.e4. It is the Rousseau Gambit (or Ponziani Countergambit) from the Italian Game (Giuoco Piano), which happens after the opening moves: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 f5. The resulting position is similar to a King's Gambit Declined with colours reversed. This gambit has a lot of tricks and traps along the way which helps Black to win within just 10 moves in these lines. <a href="https://openings-explorer.web.app/training/Vzts1uv6PJTI5nkgB2Va">Import (43 moves)</a>

If white continues after 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 with 3.e5, we enter the Advance Variation. By playing 3.e5, white is aiming for a space advantage and some attacking chances. Black can defend himself if he plays dynamically against white's pawn wedge on d4 and e5. <a href="https://openings-explorer.web.app/training/CXS3h3Pyzvl1yWl5Q5SK">Import (43 moves)</a>

If white captures on d5  after 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 with 3.exd5, we enter the Exchange Variation. After the exchange of the e5 pawns, we have a symmetrical position on the board, where white reached a simplified position. Afterwards, black is aiming to develop his pieces to start an attack. A special variation that arises out of the Exchange Variation is the so-called Monte Carlo Variation that will also be covered in this video. <a href="https://openings-explorer.web.app/training/rAPMDI40if1y3cn2HHAG">Import (45 moves)</a>
